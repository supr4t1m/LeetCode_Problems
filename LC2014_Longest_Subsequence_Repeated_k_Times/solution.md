# Intuition
The problem requires finding the longest subsequence that is repeated exactly k times in the given string. The key insight is to use a prefix-matching approach with a breadth-first search strategy. 

The main ideas are:
1. First, identify candidate characters that appear at least k times in the string
2. Start with single-character subsequences and progressively build longer subsequences
3. Use a queue to explore subsequence candidates
4. Validate each candidate by checking if it can be matched k times in the original string

# Approach
1. Frequency Counting
   - Count the frequency of each character in the string
   - Create a list of candidate characters that appear at least k times
   - Sort candidates in descending order (to prioritize lexicographically larger subsequences)

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Use a queue to generate subsequence candidates
   - Start with single-character subsequences
   - Iteratively build longer subsequences by appending candidate characters
   - Keep track of the longest valid subsequence found so far

3. Subsequence Validation
   - Create a helper function `isKRepeatedSubstring` to check if a subsequence appears k times
   - Use a greedy matching approach to count subsequence occurrences
   - If a subsequence is found k times, it's a valid candidate

# Code

```C++ []
class Solution {
public:
    string longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(string s, int k) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        vector<char> candidate;
        queue<string> q;
        string ans;

        for (char c: s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }

        for (int i='z'; i>='a'; i--) {
            if (freq[i] >= k)
                candidate.push_back(i);
        }

        for (char c: candidate) {
            q.push(string(1, c));
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            string curr = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (curr.size() > ans.size()) 
                ans = curr;
            
            for (char c: candidate) {
                string next = curr + c;

                if (isKRepeatedSubstring(next, s, k)) {
                    q.push(next);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    bool isKRepeatedSubstring(string& sub, string& s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int m = sub.length();
        int pos = 0;
        int matches = 0;

        for (char c: s) {
            if (c == sub[pos]) {
                pos++;
            }

            if (pos == m) {
                pos = 0;
                matches++;
            }

            if (matches == k) 
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n!\times\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor!)$
    - Let us consider $m=\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$, for a particular prefix length $i$, number of different possible strings from $m$ characters is $^mP_i$, we start from $i=1$ and gradually move towards the entire length $i=m$. Hence the total number of steps the outer while loop will perform is given by, 

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^m{^nP_1} = \sum_{i=1}^m\frac{m!}{(m-i)!} = m!\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{(m-i)!}$$

- Space complexity: $$O(\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor!)$$
  - At the end of each breadth, there can be $i!$ elements in the queue. Hence there can be a maximum of $\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor!$ elements in the queue. 

# Key Observations
- The approach prioritizes lexicographically larger subsequences by iterating candidates from 'z' to 'a'
- BFS ensures we find the longest subsequence systematically
- Greedy matching allows efficient subsequence validation

# Potential Optimizations
- Early pruning of candidates that cannot form a valid subsequence
- Memoization to avoid redundant validations
- More efficient subsequence matching algorithms

The solution elegantly combines frequency analysis, breadth-first search, and greedy matching to solve the problem of finding the longest k-repeated subsequence.
