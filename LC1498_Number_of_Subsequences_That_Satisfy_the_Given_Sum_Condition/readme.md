# Intuition
The problem requires finding the number of subsequences where the sum of the minimum and maximum elements is less than or equal to the target. The key insights are:
1. Sort the array to easily identify min and max elements
2. Use two-pointer technique to efficiently explore possible subsequences
3. Precompute powers of 2 to count subsequence combinations quickly

# Approach
1. Sort the input array in ascending order
2. Create a precomputation array for powers of 2 (to count subsequence combinations)
3. Use two pointers (left and right):
   - If current min (left) + current max (right) <= target
     - Add number of possible subsequences using precomputed power of 2
     - Move left pointer to include more elements
   - If sum exceeds target, move right pointer to reduce max
4. Use modulo to handle large numbers
5. Return total count of valid subsequences

# Code

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubseq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int precompute[n];
        int left = 0, right = n-1;
        int ans = 0;
        int modulo = int(1e9+7);

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        precompute[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) 
            precompute[i] = precompute[i-1]*2%modulo;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] <= target) {
                ans =  ans%modulo + precompute[right-left]%modulo;
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$
  - Sorting takes $$O(n \log n)$$
  - Two-pointer traversal takes $$O(n)$$

- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
  - Precomputation array of size n
  - Sorting might use additional space depending on implementation

# Key Observations
- Sorting allows efficient min-max identification
- Precomputing powers of 2 avoids repeated calculations and overflow. 
- Two-pointer approach provides an efficient way to explore subsequences
- Modulo operation prevents integer overflow

The solution elegantly handles the combinatorial aspect by using powers of 2, where for each valid range, the number of subsequences is $$2^{(right-left)}$$. This captures all possible combinations of elements between left and right pointers.

# Points to consider
Even in case when the elements are sorted, let us consider that, in a sorted array $$a_{min}, \ldots,  a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_{max}$$ is the order of the elements. In original array, as long as a subset consists of $$a_{min}$$ and $$a_{max}$$ with any number of $$a_i$$ s, they will always have $$a_{min}$$ as minimum and $$a_{max}$$ as maximum.
